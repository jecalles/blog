To those of you who are worried: I'm doing okay. Not great, but okay. 

To those of you out of the loop: last Wednesday, I flew back to Miami to bury my grandfather and grieve with my family. I didn't know how much I was holding in until it started coming out. I was neurotic and manic. I still am, but only in spurts now. I'm so grateful for the opportunity to be here, with my family, working through it all, together.

I'm also overwhelmed by the sheer weight of family "stuff" we've got to work through. This post is about three stuffs in particular that came up this week.

# We buried Abuelo Juan on Saturday

I will keep my thoughts short, here, because I have too many to share in one place. The funeral was on Friday. I cried three times. The burial was on Saturday. I cried thrice more. 

### On Sunday, I woke up feeling... lighter?

Relieved, certainly, knowing that his suffering was over. That my dad's suffering, doting over his dad, was over. Dad's face at the reception was alive, expressive, engaged. He was funny! He was laughing! I have been so worried for my father for so many years, seeing him drink too much and sleep too little and visit his father *every single day*. Certainly, I felt relieved. 

But it was more than that. 

### We had *grieved*

We had cried, ugly and long. We had eaten cold, mushy croquetas, the ones you only see at weddings, funerals, and birthday parties for four-year-olds. We had carried a box from hearse to church to hole-in-the-ground. And at the end of all of this, I felt... clean? Empty? At peace? Better, at least.

My Dad kept saying something to me since the burial. He said, "there's a reason why we do this". As if he was rediscovering the reason with me, reminding himself more than teaching me. That the reason for the funerary ordeals isn't for the dead. It's for the living. Again, I am so grateful that I could be here with my family to grieve with them. Without this, I don't know how much worse I'd be.

### I took notes

I wanted to remember. But more, I wanted to capture everything. In small part, I know I was being selfish. I just wanted a modicum of control in this wrenching moment. I wanted to put distance between my experience and my feelings about them, to be with the "how" and not the "how awful".

My intention is to write (a) full blog post(s) detailing the funeral and burial as best I can. Least importantly, this will be the closest I've gotten to real journalism, and I relish this opportunity like a small gift to myself. Thank you me, you shouldn't have. But mostly importantly, so much happened and I need to process it all. I hope that the writing helps. At the very least, I hope you, the reader, will enjoy the humanity of it all.

# My brother and I fought yesterday

This was one fight of many, and presumably of many more to come. Steven and I are beginning the long process of repairing our relationship. This is an ongoing story, so all I can offer is a snapshot.

### It started with a Kay commercial...

... that my brother had worked on while he was with his old company, Zimmerman. We were watching Olympus Has Fallen, but really it could've been any movie for all we cared, when the spot came on. He related how the actress, once cast, got so excited for the roll that she went and got her face carved up by some ham-handed plastic surgeon, leaving her bloody and in stitches for the shoot. Steven and crew had to work her face out of every shot. It was ironic and hilarious.

Later, another commercial came on for another jeweler. I forgot which one, but apparently Zimmerman had done that spot too. Turns out, according to Steven, both jewelers were owned by the same parent company (Signet Group, get it?), along with a few other big names.

### So I asked "isn't that a monopoly?"

Ever the leftist, I wondered aloud why the federal government hadn't broken up Signet. Dad will later give me a good argument ("there's a ton of smaller competitors. they don't own much of the market share..."), but Steven took a swing at it first. His response was something like "competition between the subsidiaries ergo not a monopoly". He talked about how marketing (*he always brings up marketing!*) can differentiate brands and create competition even within ownership groups.

But I pushed back. I had a decent understanding of what constituted a monopoly in the  eyes of the federal government, and it had *nothing* to do with marketing. It had to do with ownership and control (*he's bullshitting you again! he's always bullshitting you!*) And so I pushed back.

Steven felt like I wasn't listening to him, wasn't respecting him or his understanding of the business world. And, frankly, he was right. So he got angry. He accused me of saying he's wrong (*"he always says I'm wrong!"*) without knowing what I was talking about. That he's the one in business and I'm the one in research. That I'm overstepping (*"he's always overstepping!"*) 

It escalated from there. I accused him of chronic bullshittery. He said that I correct him on everything, even if he's right. I said that I hold my tongue nine times out of ten, but that he's just constantly out of pocket. He accuses me of never having held my tongue a day in my life. It went on, rising in tenor until we were shouting at each other.

Until something strange happened. His shouts become tears. "It always feels like a competition with you... I just wanted a brother... and I've been trying so hard... but..."

### "I don't feel safe around you..."

I don't remember the last time Steven cried. I didn't even see him cry at the funeral. I saw him mourn. I saw the loss break him. But I never saw him cry.

He vented on. He'd been holding it in for a while. All his confidants -- Mom, Dad, Tiffany (his fianc√©) -- all told him that he needed to say all this to me. He had needed this moment for years. And it showed.

When he was done, he announced that he was going to bed. I asked him to stay, to talk, just five minutes more. He wouldn't. I pleaded. "It can't just be one sided. You can't tell me all this and just walk away. This isn't how things get any better. We need to talk it through". Still, he wouldn't, until Mom interceded, and he agreed to sit for two minutes longer. He set a timer.

I didn't know what to say. I felt angry still, but shocked and distraught. I had no idea how profoundly awful he felt. I felt scared. I felt hurt, him having dumped his trauma on the table and knowing that he'd walk away if I started talking about mine. It hurt, the one-sidedness of it. But he sat down. He stayed, and that was more than he would've done in the past. And now I had to say something, with only a minute and a half or so to say it.

So, I told him that he was brave to tell me his feelings. That I didn't know how badly he felt. That he was being honest and vulnerable, and that that's what it took for things to get better. And then the timer went off.

Dad offered some final words, tying the whole conversation up neatly. It did the trick. Steven and I hugged, and he cried some more. I just held him and stared unseeingly into the yard, wondering how the fuck we were going to work this out. I don't remember much of what Dad said, but I do remember one thing. He said,

### "You both are fucked up..."

"... you just don't see how fucked up the other one is. Instead of working together to fight your little green monsters, you let them feed each."

Our dynamic has always been driven by our "little green monsters". Our pathological character loops. My need to prove I'm right. His need to prove he's smart. It's about them, and about how they play off each other. About how neither of us give an inch when held under their sway. We don't hear each other. We talk right past one another. About how easily we inflame the other, and being inflamed, how entrenched we get in our position.

Earlier, with the implicated jewelry monopoly, Steven had said something intelligent and profound about the nature of competition. He drew from his substantial experience and made substantive points about market dynamics dominated by fractured conglomerates. He was saying something interesting and real. It just didn't answer my question.

I wanted an answer. I wanted to know why lawyers weren't beating down Signet's door with court summons and pitchforks. I was asking a particular question, tightly bounded and precise in scope. Steven painted a landscape. I wanted blueprints. And I judged him on my grounds, not his. Again. Like I always do.

I wish I could say that this is the end of this story. That we had "solved" our relationship last night. But we haven't, yet. It's a process, trying to change family dynamics. It has to be a bilateral effort, sustained and consistent. It moves in small spurts with each big outbursts, in graceful steps with each gracious conversation. It helps to chat. It hurts constantly. It's a process. But we're going through it.

# I glimpsed karma in my mom's face

This one is gonna be hard to explain. It certainly deserves its own standalone post. It would end with a continuum view of (human) identity, broken down into smaller, mutually dependent parts with fuzzy boundaries and with continuity across bodies and generations. It would start with my mother's eyes. Or rather, my grandmother's eyes. In my mother's face. Maybe I'll write that post.

In case I never do, here's my best attempt to sum up this insight in brief. It requires two pieces of context and one description of a moment.

### Context the First: a sketch portrait of my grandmother

Her face cuts a permanent scowl. Even while smiling, somehow. She is critical, and petty, and withholding, and self-righteous (so self-righteous!) and absolutely clueless about how she hurts the ones she loves. I was anorexic at 200 lbs. The burial reception was an outrageous party and disrespectful to the memory of my grandfather. But she does love us. She wouldn't say any of these things to us if she didn't love us. Just, for her, love doesn't mean making us feel loved. For her, love means keeping us on the right path, chastising us if we stray off but not rewarding us if we stay true.

### Context the Second: my mother was *deeply* affected by her mother's parenting style

On the one hand, my mother swore to never become her mother. On the other hand, she's become the bizarro version of her mother. She is supportive, and empathetic and warm, and understanding and absolutely smothering. Smothering! She sees her fixation on our happiness (often to the detriment of our happiness) as love. And there can never be too much love. My mother's idea of love is deeply informed by her mother's. Upgraded, yes, but also sharing a core premise: Love is about outcomes. Love is about how things turn out for your loved ones.

### With this context, I can now describe a moment

It was the day of the funeral and we were having caf√© (obviously). I don't even remember what she was saying, but my mother was smiling while she said it. Smiling with the bottom half of her face. But her eyes were her mother's eyes, cut in their permanent scowl. 

I couldn't unsee it. I felt angry. Then I felt shocked. Then I felt overwhelmed as I briefly glimpsed the bio-karmic implications, the long and weaving histories of generations, the weight of genetic inheritance, of memetic lineage from mother to mother in a sloppy dance of family dynamics, of her EYES. I saw blood magic practiced mindlessly through eons of life and death by horny, squishy robots, themselves just evolutionary bricolage propelling their constitutive bits through space and time without a thought to the black alchemy that brought them here...

... maybe it does need it's own post.
