Last night hadn't been the first time I'd been called a faggot. It was just the first time I'd admitted to it.

# I can't remember the first time someone called me a faggot...

...but I knew they didn't mean it literally. I had gone to an all boys Catholic school in Miami from Sixth to Twelfth Grade. The word was in the very air we breathed. And nobody thought anything of it. Your friends: faggots. Your teachers: faggots. Even the women. Especially the priests. It meant nothing to us. It had been so divorced from it's literal meaning to have become completely defanged. It became linguistic seasoning, applied liberally and without thought. The first time I came out to one of my high school friends was a wonderful moment of male vulnerability. It was all the more powerful for him ending that conversation with, "alright, well, see you later faggot"! I don't mean to say that it was right for us to shout slurs with the wanton abandon of children. I mean to say we were children. Children without context. And left to our own devices, in our own context, we claimed that word. That word that many of us had no right to. And we made something grotesque and, I argue, beautiful from it. Faggot was our Shibboleth.

So, I can't remember the first time someone called me a faggot, but I know they didn't mean it literally.

# I _do_ remember the first time someone called me a faggot and meant it

It must've been Eighth or Ninth Grade. I was on the Junior Varsity Football Team. I played Tight End (what a gay name for a position, huh?) I remember his name, but I won't say. I'll call him "L". He was a skinny thing, but powerful. Dark skin, strong jaw and cheekbones, plump, taught lips. If internalized-homophobia-turned-self-hatred-turned-gaybashing ever took flesh, he did so in this poor, confused, hot young thing. Not that I thought anything of him at the time, or really of any boy. Sure, I liked to hang around some guys, with the puppy dog fervor a clueless young queer. 

L must've known at some level what I didn't yet. Something about me brought up something in him. I'll never know what he was feeling, but I'll never forget what he did and said. We were at football practice. He grabbed me by the facemask and slammed our helmets together, bringing us eye to eye. Then he stared at me. I'll never forget the intensity of that stare. There was anger, but something else. Pain? Arousal? Fear? He called me a faggot. He spat the words out. I can't forget the way his lips moved, jabbing at the air, emoting. They moved like latin hips. In hindsight, the whole thing was pretty hot, but I was just terrified and confused at the time.

So, I can remember the first time someone called me a faggot and meant it. But last night was the first time someone called me a faggot, didn't mean it, but meant to hurt me. And what a queer situation to find oneself in.

# So last night...

... I had caught up with my pandemic roommate, Anton, at our pub, the Rose and Crown. I rushed to the Palo Alto Caltrain station to catch the 7:18 northbound back to the City. I get to the station five minutes early, when I start watching the departures board flip from "on time" to "1 min late", then to "2 min late", and on and on. Shit. They were single-tracking. It's cold and I'm gonna be here for a while. I threw down my bag in frustration and settled in. 

Enter, the punk: an Adidas-clad, skinny fat, knuckle-dragger standing 10 yards from me, sucking on a cigarette and inexplicably flipping me off. I guess he didn't like my attitude, throwing my bag down and all. But fuck him, it's cold out and I'm mad, so I flip him off too. And that's when he squares up to me and starts shouting.

"Do you think your funny?" the punk asked me?

"Do you?" I half retort? Forgive me, I was three English-pints deep and running of four hours of sleep. I wasn't quite giving Hemingway. 

A pause. Did this merit a pause? You can almost hear the emaciated hamster in his overlarge skull working overtime to spin the two gears. 

"Why are your pants so tight? You some kind of faggot?" See, this punk meant to call me a faggot in that abstract, knee-jerk way that men often do. He didn't actually visualize me in the throws of homosexual passion. I doubt he possessed the mental faculties. No, he meant to emasculate me and hadn't the the brains come up with anything better.

Drunk, and realizing that this was quickly escalating, I dropped my face into a relaxed and toothy grin, cocked my head half sideways and said, "well, you've got me right, there." I brought those eyes, L's eyes. The eyes of radical admission, of gay pain laid bare and weaponized. It felt good. It felt _sooo_ good.

After that, he made a cursory attempt to push this altercation further ("how about I break your nose, huh?"), but I put my headphones back on and ignored him. The train came ten minutes later, we boarded separate cars, and got off at 4th and King. He shot me a furtive, sideways glance, then dead ass stopped until I passed him, afraid of having me walk behind him. I cackled and went on my way.
