# To my one regular reader:

Apologies for the break in content. 

Busy week, as you might know. 

I thank you for your patience. 

Now, on with the show.

# writing is hard

Well, not that hard, comparatively. Mining is hard. Brain surgery is hard. But writing is challenging. 

It's funny. I thought that I understood my thoughts until I tried to write them down. I'd have ideas that I thought were concrete and nuanced. These ideas _felt_ like they had shape and form, but then I'd struggle to write down even their core premises.

# I killed my first post today

I started a post about my upcoming flight from MIA to SFO from the airport on Tuesday. Then yesterday, I tried to add some more details from the flight. Today I scrapped the whole piece.

I was getting hung up on execution. Fundamentally, there were only three ideas in the whole piece:

1. Saying "Go Bulldogs!" to University of Georgia fans in the airport post National Championship game made me feel good, but then bad because I'm not actually a Georgia fan.

2. The woman in the aisle seat of my row had mobility issues that I only learned about when I asked her to get up so I could go to the bathroom, so I just held in in for the next four hours of the flight.

3. The movie BROS was good, but probably inappropriate on a flight (cause, you know, there's a LOT of sex in it)

Look. There you go. There's the post.

# growing pains

In writing the aborted blog post above, I struggled on two different aspects of capturing the above ideas: 

1. core idea (why did I want to say this thought at all?) 

2. nuances (what to keep? what to toss? how to say?)

Take, for instance, the UGA fans idea. The core of this idea came from a feeling during a single interaction. I passed a middle aged couple hurrying to their gate. They were the first people I saw in Georgia gear. I called out to them "go dogs". We pass each other by. Only then do they process what I said, and with surprise and delight they call back "go dogs!". I feel warm and fuzzy, like part of an in group. 

_That feeling!_ Being part of their tribe. A sense of camaraderie with perfect strangers. That was the core idea.

Then, I drowned in the nuances.

I wanted to capture how many other people I saw afterwards wearing Georgia gear (in the hallway, in the bathroom, on the flight). I wanted to capture how I _didn't_ call out to them. How I made myself feel weird for not calling out to _them_ too. How feelings of empathy turned into self flagellation. I was an impostor. All of these were secondary ideas, but they felt powerful. They added contours. They were nuances.

And in trying to capture all these nuances, I killed the core idea. _That feeling_. That feeling of belonging.

# It's getting better

Maybe I just needed a blank page to get the ideas out better. Maybe I just needed distance to mute all but the most salient memories. Maybe the writing practice is helping. But I got the ideas out today.

And here you are reading them.

Enjoy, there will be more
