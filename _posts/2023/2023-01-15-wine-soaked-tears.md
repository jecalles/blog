# Dionysus, you tea-thirsty hoe

I came out yesterday to have a good time, not be read like a book! Wine god, you have _zero_ chill. Be more sauvignon blanc, less savage-on-blast!

I have three old and dear friends, Wes, Ben, and Rina. We (and Lara) all lived in the same housing at Stanford, a rowdy cluster of three story midrises connected by overwatered lawns and decorated with lemon trees and wild hares, called Rains. We all became "Community Associates" (read: social organizers) at Rains. We threw the parties. That's where we met.

Rina was half of *the* "it" couple of Rains before a truly messy and awfully public breakup. Sides were drawn and Wes, being friends with Rina's ex, now found himself on the wrong side of the line. No hard feelings, just regret, loss and pain. Well, Rina defends her PhD and moves to the City. Wes defends his and gets a job in the South Bay. Years pass, the hatchet dissolves more than gets buried, and Rina and Wes start to hang out again. I like to claim a tiny fraction of credit for this. 

See, after Rina was no longer in *the* "it" couple of Rains, I was, with Lara. We were *the* it couple of Rains. Then we left Rains. Then she left me. And I felt so alone. So I reached out to Rina, and Wes reached out to me, and Rina told me over Greek tapas and Shiraz that she missed Wes, and Wes told me over soggy pizza and Italian lager that he missed her, and so we made plans to "bake a thing" at Rina's apartment and ended up ordering Szechuan and watching football instead. It was wonderful! It felt amazing to rekindle Rains relationships outside of Rains, especially since our shared context was so strong ([chanted] "we are not a cult") that it was scary and reasonable to think we might not be friends outside of Rains.

Anyway, we decided that should the Patriots not be in the playoffs (Rina's greatest weakness is her Boston sports fandom) that we should go wine tasting 14 January, and Wes should bring his partner Christina, and that we must drag Ben along. And so we did. We drank for six hours in Sonoma county. The wine was excellent, and excessive on account of our flirting with the wine server. We were *drunk*. Well, save Christina, who was our designated driver and tasted each round without finishing her glass. Finishing her glass fell to me and Ben, who happily obliged. Drunk, and happy, we headed back to San Francisco. It was a happy moment.

Well, except that Ben kept telling me that "we had stuff to talk about" (which we did).

# Ben told "there's no other, greener grass..."

"... there's just your grass." And he was right, but I should probably explain.

Christina pulled up next to my apartment, threw her hazards on, and Ben and I stumbled out of the car and into the corner store to pick up a \$12 bottle of Joel Gott's Sauvignon Blanc. We didn't say it, but we knew that no matter how much we'd already drunk, we'd need more to help us through this talk. We were finally gonna talk about Lara.

Ben, Lara and I (Jon) called ourselves a "thruple". We had a thruple name, "BLON". He helped convince her to go out with me once I asked. We stayed close all throughout our relationship, until Ben to do his fieldwork, once planned for in a tiny mining town in Lesotho, now in a tiny mining town near his hometown of Vancouver due to COVID. There, he stayed until last week. Excited to be back, he'd apparently reached out to Lara, who broke the news to him. She gave him no details, offering instead to talk about in person (before promptly flying to DC on a whim to help our friend Joan pick a wedding dress? This woman is chaos and anxiety incarnate). So, Ben found himself no longer in a thruple and with a lot of questions.

And so I told him how Lara ended things. I told him some of her complaints. I told him how we talked about moving in together into the City and she said no, opting instead to fly to London for a wedding, move her stuff into storage, then go to Burning Man (chaos). She had complained to Ben about not having housing coming back from her trips, about how stressful it was (anxiety). Ben now felt lied to, not having known the full story. I told Ben about how she never met my family. How she didn't meet my brother even when he was in town. I told Ben how she never wanted to spend time with my friends. How we always had to spend time with hers. How she'd get mad when I'd call them "her" friends ("their your friends too!" Nope.)

The bottle went emptying, and Ben, astutely in spite of the wine, read me to hung up. "Jon," he said, "you're waiting on her to give you closure, but it's just not gonna happen. It's over. You had a good run together, but it's over. There is no other greener, grass..."

We laid down on my foam, fold-up faux mattress and he held me. And I cried. Then he called an ride home and I made myself garlic buttered noodles, briefly contemplated going out a club, realized that I was far too drunk, drank some water and went to sleep.

The next day, I woke up to a crushing hangover and some terrible news.

# Abuelo Juan is dying

But seriously. For real this time.

Anyone who knows me well knows that Abuelo Juan has been near death for four years now. Some even know that he got kicked out of hospice for outliving his welcome (go you, Abu). He's survived two strokes _and_ COVID _and_ kidney infections _and_ that's just the stuff my family has the heart to tell me about. He's nearly died so many times that we've just become numb to it. We've developed a naive distrust of our own eyes and instincts. No matter how bad he's looked, no matter what the doctors have said, no matter how little time they give him, we kind of shrug and say "well, he hasn't died yet, and he's been through worse".

Abuelo Juan hasn't died yet. He's been through worse. But he's lost over 40 pounds in the last two months and was struggling to swallow. And now he's caught COVID. 

As of my writing this post, he's stable but scary bad. The doctors have him on morphine, four boluses a day, to make him "comfortable". What an awful way to put it.

My dad told me to say my goodbyes last week, before I left from Miami. He knew. I knew too. We've "known" before and been wrong. We knew this time. When I last saw him, he was laid out in his recliner, covered in two blankets, the saggy folds of skin falling off his feeble arms with crosshatched wrinkles. I'd seen these wrinkles before. I had a great aunt who lived to be 93 and died when I was 6. I forgot her name, but I loved her. She had arm skin like that, at the end at least. I used to play with her skin folds. She loved it. I knew when I saw his arm that Abuelo Juan was dying.

His caretaker, Fe, was out of town on vacation (she deserves it!) and another woman was substituting for her. I forgot her name too, but she was in her late 50s, dark skinned and spoke in a familiar accent of Spanish that I couldn't quite place. Cuban, probably. She had a nervous chattiness to her. She couldn't let me sit and stare into my grandfather's eyes and just _be_ with him. She had to talk with me, and about absolute banalities. I left that day with regret.
