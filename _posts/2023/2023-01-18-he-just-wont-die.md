I'm writing this post at 9:56 am PT and as of this moment, my grandfather is still alive.

My family has been holding vigil in my grandparents' home for three days. He hasn't urinated for the last two. We haven't been able to feel his pulse for 18 hours. His blood oxygen dropped below 50%. You can paint our suffering by the numbers.

His breathing haunts me. The sound of it. It's a roaring tidal flow. It's laborious. I can feel his effort, see his chest heave from across the continent. That sound, it cuts through the phone static, the background chit chat, my grandmother's self-comforting puttering (she needs to feel useful). His strength, his ferocity, was mythic. Here we finally see the depths of his strength spilt out, breath on breath, for **seventy two hours** and with no sign of stopping. That breathing is his swan song, a stubborn verse sung solo and off key, a last refrain belting through the rafters and that will forever echo in my head.

~~Dad is taking it well~~. You know what? I can't actually tell. It feels like he's put his full mind to keeping the rest of our families fragile ones from fraying apart into true madness. Abuela Ivette has *been* mad, but she is finally coming to terms with the finality in front of us. She'd always feared that Abuelo Juan would outlive her and have to suffer alone, but I doubt she ever contemplated the alternative. Tita -- my aunt, Juan's daughter -- is not taking it well at all. She'd been daddy's-little-girl and he'd spoiled her silly. It's a mess.

Everyone I've ever talked to who's suffered a death has told me that the biggest shock was the sheer logistics of dying. I feel like I knew that to be true, intellectually. It's an entirely different thing to do the logistics. Church, funeral home, cemetery. A macabre ménage à trois, a stygian thruple, and overbooked bidges all of them. And the flights. Ugh. But honestly, it's been a welcome distraction for my dad. It gives him something concrete, actionable, over which he has a modicum of control. It lets him be useful. I'm grateful.

Tonight I'll pack a bag. For now, I wait on standby.

UPDATE 11:24 PT, SAN FRANCISCO

I spoke too soon. My mom called me an hour ago.She said nothing at first, just sobbed and sniffled. I knew. He's dead.

My dad was with him at the end. They were able to share some soft words. I don't know what they said. What can you say? What parting words would you give, son to father?
