Unlike last year (curse you, COVID!) I found myself fortunate enough to be home for the holidays at the end of 2022. Naturally, I found myself periodically and profoundly bored between family meals and arguments, and sought comfort deep in the bowels of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com). I was desperate for some :lustful voice: *content* and mostly found it. Heard of a [nomograph](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34211187)? It's how [old timey engineers would calculate numbers by drawing lines on pretty graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram) and I'm OBSESSED! Here's one that let's you calculate how much a tomato breathes![tomato breathing intensifies](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mahmut-Cetin/publication/291787697/figure/fig1/AS:669425556549650@1536614898772/A-nomograph-for-daily-estimation-of-ET-a-for-tomato-Courtesy-of-Drs-Tueluecue-and-Cetin.png "劫舒窶昨汳ｨ")

In the days leading up to New Year's Eve 2022, Hacker News seemed to be innundated with posts *begging* people to start a blog. Maybe it's because fellow nerds in similar familial sitations thirsted for the *content*. It could just be an elaborate "noes goes". Who's willing to try having an original thought so the rest of us could *just* consume? Maybe it's because blogging is, in fact, very dumb. It may be that the few bloggers dumb enough to try now feel dumb for trying, and want to justify their decisions by convincing future rubes to join their ranks. I doubt it though. Maybe it's genuinely a good idea to try writing your ideas down. Maybe this is how we get #gooddiscourse again. Probably not, but it does sound fun.

Anyways, here's that blog. This is my first blog post. If you have thoughts, I'd love to hear them! You either know where to find me, or you don't.
