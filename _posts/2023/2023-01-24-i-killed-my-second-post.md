# I'm tracking the posts I kill

Part of the reason why I'm writing this blog at all is to get better at writing. Yes, there's my short term goal of getting in shape to write my dissertation. Yes, there's the "love of the craft" and all that jazz. But I've wanted to write, wanted to be *good* at writing, since I was a child. I wanted to be Asimov: prolific, far-sighted, awful at writing dialogue. And female characters. And characters. I love Asimov.

Anyway, I'm trying to get better at writing. So I want to pay attention to *how* I write, and more to the point, how I *don't* write. And so, I've decided to do a post-mortem every time I try and fail to write.

# I tried to write about my ex's cousin after three whiskeys

I found myself at The Page, my favorite little cash bar in the City, on the corner of Divisadero and (you guessed it) Page. Leather chairs, dark red lighting, wood paneling, faux oil portraits of long-dead English lords, and \$6 pours from heavy handed barkeeps. It's become my local hole.

I ordered a particular whiskey. They said they were out, so I asked for another. They poured. I paid. I sit, and get collared by a patron, pointing at a second, very full glass. They weren't out, apparently. "For your troubles". The cause of my troubles, maybe, but I never turn down free drink.

So I settle down with my two very full glasses -- three fingers in each, enough to kill Inigo Montoya's father -- and settle into my book, Agatha Christie's *And Then There Were None*. Fantastic read! I got to page 99 and read a sentence that struck me. "I bet you she had a cup of tea. That sort always does." This sentence reminded me so vividly of my ex (Lara) 's cousin Yaya that it compelled me to capture that feeling.

See, the story I wanted to tell is simple. Yaya was briefly in town (London) after a long absence and before galavanting again. Lara and I were there for a wedding. And Yaya's thinly-veiled recurring request to spend time with her aunt and cousin and this weird man-type her cousin brought home was to "have a cup of tea". So British. So lovely. In getting to know her, I learned that she did, in fact, like tea. However, not nearly as much as she loved her people, nor as much as she associated tea time with Lara's mom, Caroline (are you happy now, ladies Spencer?). Anyway, I love Yaya, and it hurt to realize so totally in that one moment that I would *never* see this woman again.

# I got myself lost, then frustrated

Instead of telling the story I set out to tell, I ended up trying to tell four:

1. My evening at the Page

2. The wedding in England (and therefrom, my inspiration to read Agatha Christie)

3. Yaya uses tea to hang with the family

4. A portrait of Yaya as a person

Even in this post, you'll notice, I gave in to the temptation of writing about multiple stories. There's enough connecting these stories that it would have been a satisfying write (and I hope a good read), but a challenging one. Definitely too large of a scope for a quick post written at the end of a night that began with free whiskey. 

And so, I felt like this post had gotten too big too finish tonight and that I'd need multiple writing sessions to finish it. And, fair! Worth! 

But I also found myself fixating on needing to get out this post *that night*. As if the magic of that moment would be stale in the morning. I think it has something to do with the fact that these posts come with dates of publication. It felt weird to write about *yesterday's* feelings for some reason. And it felt weirder to fudge the dates post-facto. And so, I got frustrated.

# I was also writing out of pocket

Let me explain. For one, too much whiskey. I tend to speak and write and think in dense and ornate language. I normally overwrite, then pair down until I get something presentable. When I can't say something with a baroque a sentence, I can't say it at all!  But whiskey anesthetizes the tongue. 

Moreover, I made a crucial error. The story I *wanted* to write, was prepared to write, was fundamentally about *me*. About my feelings during events that I took part in and relating to people I know. The story I *tried* to write was fundamentally about *Yaya*. I tried to paint a portrait of her and I'd truly only known her a few times and a few months ago. My story was about my loss, about losing the chance to be in her life, to know her well enough to capture her.

And so I fixated on what I thought I should be writing, not on what I wanted to write. I got stuck on what I didn't know how to say (or what to say) and not what brought me to the keyboard in the first place

Lessons learned!
