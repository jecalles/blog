# we just don't talk anymore

...and really, that's on me. But it's not because I don't care anymore. I do care. 

What we have? This? It's been so special. It's been vital elixir, at least for me. I hope it's been good for you. Or, at least, _was_, when it was still happening more regularly. 

I'm sorry I didn't write. It's been a busy month and I lost myself in it. I probably did have time to write, but I just couldn't bring myself to.

# I drafted my dissertation

...in two weeks. 145 pages. One chapter had been written since 2019. Another, we had finished the day before Christmas. But the third was unwritten in *any* form. I had to write it entirely from scratch. In two weeks. By myself. Raw data, to outline, to draft, plus figures, and edits. In two weeks. Alone. 

Well, it felt lonely, at least. I didn't do it alone though. I had excellent strategic counsel (shoutout AM) and timely, thoughtful editors (shoutout AM, BA, SS). Without them, I'm not sure if I could have done it. I wasn't alone. But I *felt* alone. I had to own this project, my thesis, alone. That's the point, I guess.

I slept eight hours a night, every single night. I woke up in a panic, every single morning. I drank a liter of coffee a day, if I was cutting back. I ordered takeout to save time cooking (I love cooking). I gave myself time to cry, to pace, or to work. As a treat, I'd indulge in a conversation with a friend. Often over coffee. I stopped consuming any content that wasn't going to be cited. And, I stopped producing any content that wasn't going into my dissertation.

And on Tuesday, 14 March, at 10am PT, I submitted a draft of my dissertation to my reading committee. And then went right back to work. I had to make slides, because one week later...

# I defended my thesis

...on Tuesday, 21 March, at noon.

It was a frantic sprint right up to the very day. By 4pm on the 14th (Tuesday), I had a first draft presentation. By 5:30pm, I had presented it at group meeting, gotten feedback, and thrown out the whole deck. 

I spent the next three days in a notebook instead of a screen. I drafted ideas, claims, figures, and their combinations into arguments and flows. I threw out half of it. But in the end, I had a talk. And I had it memorized. I only needed to make slides.

My parents flew in on St. Patrick's Day (Fri). They only saw me at dinners, but they saw me swing wildly from tired but confident over casoulet at Le Central (Sat) to morbid and dreadful over pizza at Berreta (Sun). But on Sunday at Che Fico over mocktails, they saw me at peace. 131 slides, nearly perfect (they wouldn't be until 10am the next day). There was no other preparation I could do. I did everything I could. 

I booked the auditorium. In the end, I _needed_ the auditorium. Forty or fifty people must've shown up, and another sixty on zoom. I talked too fast. I thought I'd go over the hour I'd been given, but I was already on my acknowledgments in half that time. But my audience was engaged, the *whole* time! They were curious, and interested, and asked thoughtful questions (so many questions!) but most importantly, they were there.

We drank fifteen bottles of champagne in the Shriram Tea Room, and then the power went out. What a fitting metaphor. I was elated, but dissociated, manically jumping from conversation to conversation as my nerves slowly dissipated anxious energy accrued over... months? Years? On the drive back to the city, I crashed. I slumped in the passenger seat, staring unseeingly out the window, as a van full of people celebrated me, and I felt deeply empty.

The next morning, I woke up empty, too. But it felt good. I was filled with space. For the first time in my life. No need to ask "what's next?"

# What's next?

Funny thing about life though, you do eventually have to figure out what's next.

For me, for now, what's next is this blog post, which I write from a snowed-in cabin in Tahoe, surrounded by dear friends and celebrating _someone else_. I can think about myself and my life on this page, then forget about myself for a weekend and be with others.

What's after that? Well, I'm hoping to write more. I set up a [substack](https://jonwrites.substack.com/). There's nothing up there, yet, but I'm hoping to use it for more "professional" material. Perspectives, short stories, news and views, perhaps a Q&A? I want to continue to grow in my writing, and I think that involves writing self-motivated, "serious" pieces. Emphasis on self-motivated. I've written seriously, and I've done so recently, and will do so shortly, but never for myself.

# What about this blog?

This blog will remain a personal blog. Here is where all the emotional processing goes. Here's where all the unpolished poems go. Here is my online diary, essentially.

But I'm taking the link down. I don't pretend that there's privacy on the internet, but I don't want to advertise this space.

If you know where to find this blog, congratulations. You're in the inner circle. Welcome.

I welcome feedback and comments. You know how to get a hold of me. Let me know where I should be taking this space. I look forward to talking.
