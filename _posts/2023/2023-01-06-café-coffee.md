# I had my first cup of coffee...

... when I was twelve, in an IHOP on a school trip to [checks notes] Saint Augustine? Whatever, the *where* is the least important part of this context. I snuck in my first coffee order while the chaperones weren't looking: "American coffee, black, please". Just like my dad likes his coffee. Turns out, *not* how 12 year old me liked his coffee. But I was in too deep! The coffee was in front of me and I was determined to drink it by any means necessary, including [checks notes] *STRAWBERRY SYRUP???*

As I tinkered with my dirt water -- next trying pancake syrup, at one point reaching for the butter, all just trying to extract even a bit of pleasure from drinking this increasingly complicated concoction -- one of my teachers finally noticed that I was giving "child dislikes coffee; wants to feel older" and intervened. 

"Are you old enough to be drinking coffee?" Panic set in. I've been had! 

"Do your parents let you drink coffee?" Relief. This WASP misstepped, bringing a Cuban family into a coffee argument. I had this. I responded, "oh, of course they do. In fact, you can call them right now and ask."

And they did. 

I don't know what my parents said. All I remember is that the teacher left me alone to my continued adulterations.

Oh, and I remembered one more thing...

# *this coffee isn't sweet enough*

See, IHOP isn't where I had my first coffee beverage. It was where I had my first *coffee*. My first american *coffee*. Drip, if you will. My first coffee beverage was *café cubano* some years earlier and with some frequency since. 

*Coffee* drinking, to then me, represented an aged sophistication, an all-American ritual of masculinity (I know. We're learning, we're growing, pardon our dust). And there was a particular manliness in coffee taken **black**. Black as the night. *Negro azabache*. Bitter and powerful, like the man I wanted to become (WE'RE LEARNING! WE'RE GROWING!)

*Café cubano* is *not* powerful. Strong for its size? Certainly, but not in an absolute sense, being served in small quantities. Almost always in a dainty cup (a white, plastic thimble if you're going for authenticity) and invariably topped with its own *cremita*. 

*Café cubano* is *not* bitter. Calling it "sweet" is a tragic understatement. Like, 50% w/v sugar, sweet. Coming from *café* and trying coffee, it's no wonder I was trying to drown my mug of IHOP mud in syrup!

# I may have a problem

Today, I drink all types of coffee (and without the weird associations, thank you kindly!), including drip coffee. And yes, just like my dad, I now take it black. Black as the ace of spades.

Not only that, but I *drink* coffee. Like, pot of coffee before leaving home and my *first* 24 oz thermos right when I get to work, I drink coffee. Like, last cup of the day is at 5pm but I'll still have an espresso at dinner cause that doesn't count, I drink coffee. Like, a substantial amount of my micronutrients come from coffee, I drink coffee. Like, sometimes I worry that my only true friends are the ladies at Bytes Café, I drink coffee. I *love* coffee.

But God's sweat drips black and it comes out of a *cafetera*. As much as I love coffee, I prefer *un cafecito, por favor.*
