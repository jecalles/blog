Slumping into the musty couch 

that gave us all sniffly noses,

staring at the gas fireplace

unseeingly, eyes unfocused.

-

Next to the fire, a rack of tabloids,

"Brad and Jen's Separate Lives"

splayed across the frontmost cover,

and a ukulele I swear belongs to you.

-

In front of the fire, a lime green 

mechanical buffer

that they used the night before

to massage each other.

-

Its power cables are knotted tangles,

still plugged in to the extension

running under the finished puzzle,

next to the bag of dried mangos.

-

Piano arpeggios pour

softly out of the big speaker

that pounded the desert months ago,

still painted with once wet dust.

-

Evergreens tile across the bay window,

powder blue sky and 

forest-clad mountains

spilling through the cracks.

-

I see two trees, roots entwined,

trunks twisting about each other,

now branching apart, leaves starved, 

grasping for sunlight.
